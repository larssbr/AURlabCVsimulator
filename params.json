  "body": "### Welcome to Aurlabcvsimulator.\r\nHi, I hope you find this project interesting!\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nYou are welcome to continue to develop this simulator and add different methods to improve obstacle avoidance. \r\nThings that would be cool to add:\r\n- automatic scene interpretation\r\n- anchor\r\n- object recognition\r\n- egometry from motion\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn the spring of 2016, Lars Brusletto (@larssbr) wrote his master thesis: Computer Vision based Obstacle Avoidance for an ROV.\r\nThis is a bi-product of that work. He needed a simulator to test the feasibility of different obstacle avoidance algorithms. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Aurlabcvsimulator? Check out the documentation at http://aurlabcvsimulator.readthedocs.io/ or contact support at (https://github.com/larssbr) or larsbrusletto@gmail.com and I will help you sort it out.",
