# AURlabCVsimulator
This repository is made for testing different computer vision methods by simulating a mission done in Trondheimsfjorden in April 2016

## Mehtods that are being tested

### Mono camera methods
- SLIC SUperpixel Locally Binary Pattern method
- SLIC SUperpixel Harlick method

### Stereo camera methods
- Dipsarity method

### Development list- tings to do
# todo: change segment with youst analyzing 100 boxes in the image. 
---> it will be alot faster than calculating the segments.  The segment calculation is the biggest bottleneck

### Usefull links to understnad parts of the code faster

#### Unifrom Local Binary Pattern (watch this to understand better):
